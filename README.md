# Palindrome Checker 🪞

A simple Python script that checks if a sentence is a palindrome.  
It ignores spaces, punctuation, and letter casing — focusing only on the actual characters.

## 🔍 How It Works
- Removes all non-alphanumeric characters using regex.
- Converts the sentence to lowercase.
- Compares the cleaned string with its reverse.

## 🧪 Example
```bash
Input:  "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: The sentence is a palindrome
```
